{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
Schemes determine the overall look of a graph; see help {help schemes}.

{p 4 4 2}
Scheme {cmd:lean2} specifies a lean black-and-white look similar to that 
used by many scientific journals. The plot area has horizontal gridlines 
like schemes {cmd:s2color} and {cmd:s2mono}.


{title:Remarks}

{p 4 4 2}
The schemes {cmd:lean1} and {cmd:lean2} have no background tinting; markers are black; bars and areas have black outline; y-axis labels are horizontal; and legends are placed to the right of the plot area. The difference between the two 
is that scheme {help scheme_lean1:lean1} has a framed plot area without gridlines, while {cmd:lean2} has horizontal gridlines, but no frame. The general idea is described in:
