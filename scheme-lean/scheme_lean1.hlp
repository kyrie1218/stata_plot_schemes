{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
Schemes determine the overall look of a graph; see help {help schemes}.

{p 4 4 2}
Scheme {cmd:lean1} specifies a lean black-and-white look similar to that 
used by many scientific journals. The plot area is framed like
schemes {cmd:s1color} and {cmd:s1mono}.


{title:Remarks}

{p 4 4 2}
The schemes {cmd:lean1} and {cmd:lean2} have no background tinting, markers
are black, bars and areas have black outline, y-axis labels are horizontal,
and legends are placed to the right of the plot area. The difference between
the two is that scheme {cmd:lean1} has a framed plot area without gridlines,
while {help scheme_lean2:lean2} has horizontal gridlines, but no frame.
